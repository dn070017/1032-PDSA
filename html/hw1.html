<h1>HW1 - Familiar with Java (II)</h1>
In this homework, you will be guided to learn:<br>
(a) implementing Java classes as requested;<br>
(b) calling class functions;<br>
(c) getting familiar with ArrayList;<br>
(d) String comparison;<br>
(e) using Iterator<br>

<h3>Assignment</h3>
Poker Game: <br>
In the Chinese New Year, cognates play poker game in family parties. Each player is dealt to five cards. Your program is requested to identify which players have a hand of Flush (A flush is a poker hand, where all five cards are of the same suit).<br>
<br>
In this homework, there are three Java classes involved. Please design the Game (main) Class and implement one function of the Player Class. The Game Class deals five cards to each player (the number of players is given in the first line of the input file), and calls the function of the Player Class to judge if it is a hand of Flush. In the end, print out the players who have a hand of Flush.<br>
<br>
<h3>Files</h3>
<a href="Game.java">Game.java</a>, <a href="Player.java">Player.java</a>, <a href="Card.java">Card.java</a> (do not modify 'Card.java')<br>
<br>
<b>Input Example:</b><a href="hw1.in.txt">hw1.in.txt</a><br>

<h3>Submission</h3>
When you are doing the homework, you put all the three class files in the same project. When submitting the homework, you will be requested to upload 'Player.java' and 'Game.java' separately. These two files will be judged independently, which means that you are not allowed to modify the interface of the functions.<br>
<br>
<h3>Help</h3>
1. ArrayList (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html) You might use functions such as 'add'.<br>
2. String (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html) You might use functions such as 'equals' or 'split'.<br>
3. Iterator
