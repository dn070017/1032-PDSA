Please write a program (CriticalDis.java) that reads in N 2-dimensional points. An edge is defined as:

v is pointing to w, if and only if the distance between v and w is smaller than d, and x(v) < x(w) and y(v) < y(w). We further define the source s as the point with the smallest x(s)+y(s), and target t as the point with the largest x(t)+y(t).

Please report the smallest d, which generates at least one path from s to t.
