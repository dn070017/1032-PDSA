<h1>HW3 - Algorithm analysis</h1>
<h3>Assignment 3-1: perform log-log plot anlaysis on your HW2-2 program</h3>
<p>Hand in HW3-1 in Ceiba. You are expected to generate a log-log plot for your HW2-2 program using the attached input files (input size: 2k, 4k, 8k, 16k, 32k, 64k, 128k). After that, estimate the parameters a and b in the formula: T(m) ~ a * m^b, where m is the number of reads in the input file.</p>
<b>Input file set: </b><a href="HW3-20150318.zip">HW3-20150318.zip</a><br>
<br>
<b>Note: </b>You can use Stopwatch to record execution time:<br>
<br>
Stopwatch timer = new Stopwatch();<br>
... Your code ...<br>
StdOut.println("elapsed time = " + timer.elapsedTime());<br>

<h3>Assignment 3-2: redesign your algorithm for HW2-2.</h3>
<p>This time, your program is expected to execute within 15 seconds for the input file with m = 128k. Submit your new program ReadAssembler.java in the course judger.</p>
